# A11y Frontend Workshop

## Setup

Run `npm install`

## Usage

Run `npm start`

## Requirements

You need Node.js v20 or higher.

If you are currently running on a lower Node.js version, because any of your projects are dependent on that lower version, make sure to downgrade to that version **after** this workshop!

In order to automate this, consider installing [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on your machine.
