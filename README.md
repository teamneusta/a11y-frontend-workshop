# A11y Frontend Workshop

## Setup

Run `npm install`

## Usage

Run `npm start`

## Requirements

You need Node.js v20 or higher.

If you are currently running on a lower Node.js version, because any of your projects are dependent on that lower version, make sure to downgrade to that version **after** this workshop!

In order to automate this, consider installing a node version manager on your machine:
- UNIX
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - [n](https://github.com/tj/n)
- Windows
  - [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

## Docker

In case you don't have Node.js installed locally, you can use Docker to run the project:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The install and the run commands are executed automatically. 

Shortly after starting, the project page will be reachable at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
